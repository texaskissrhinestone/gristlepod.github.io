	  <h2>general commission info</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A "commission" is defined by the time it takes to work on a request, not exclusive ownership of an artwork. Every serviced image is explicit property of Gristlepod, and licensed for commissioner usage.</li>
        <li>Terms of service may change at any time. Slot holders will be informed of updated terms during queue.</li>
        <li>All payments (USD) are taken through Ko-fi unless otherwise specified.</li>
        <li>TAT for each piece will vary from a week to months, so request deadlines upon discussion.</li>
        <li>Price negotiations are allowed.</li>
      </ul>
